Yo people!
We’ve all tried those link-in-bio thingies like Lintree, Bedlam GG, or whatever’s trending — either to flex our gamer stats or just dump all our random links in one place, right?

Well… instead of dropping cash on that, I thought — why not just make my own? Because if you can build it, why buy it? (Or maybe I’m just a hyperfixated autistic gremlin — who knows.)

Silly stuff aside, c’mon — let me show you around!
